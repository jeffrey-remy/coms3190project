            <p class="card-text">My name is Ryan Meyer, and I’m currently a junior in the Software Engineering program
              at Iowa State University. While I don’t have experience with website design outside of class, I’m
              thoroughly enjoying the course and have developed a strong interest in web development. I’m also passionate
              about music and have always appreciated the sense of discovery and community found in old record stores,
              much like some subreddits today. I believe this project would be a great way to highlight album art and
              relevant information, and it has the potential to be expanded further. </p>

            <p class="card-text">My name is Jeffrey Remy, and I’m a senior in Computer Science and Mathematics with
              Applications at Iowa State University. I have had some experience with web design in the past, mostly using
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with hard-coded content as opposed to automatically generated HTML with JSON
              files. I am an avid music listener and have developed a strong interest in albums in the past year. I look
              forward to developing this project to highlight some of my favorite albums and provide a way for others to
              explore and discover great albums as well. </p>
